# --- Configuration ---
# Set the thickness of the lead target
# You can change this value (e.g. 5 cm, 10 mm)
/BFS/geometry/leadThickness 2 cm

# Set the energy of the electron beam
/gun/energy 1 GeV

# --- Execution ---
# Print progress every 100 events
/run/printProgress 100

# Run the simulation with 1000 events (electrons)
# Increase this for better statistics (e.g. 10000)
